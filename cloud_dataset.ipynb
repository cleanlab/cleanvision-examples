    "# Run CleanVision on a dataset in cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "CleanVision checks can be run on a dataset residing in a cloud storage as well. It currently supports S3, Google Cloud Storage and Azure Blob Storage. Before using CleanVision on a cloud dataset, the appropriate storage needs to be configured on the machine. See the recommended ways to configure different storages on the machine if not already configured\n",
    "\n",
    "- S3 (`\"s3://\"`): `aws configure` (same as `boto` configuration).\n",
    "- Google Storage (`\"gs://\"`): `gcloud auth login`.\n",
    "- Azure Blob Storage (`\"az://\"`): you need to pass your secrets in the `storage_opts`. This is also an option for S3 and Google Storage but is generally not recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally CleanVision uses `fsspec` library to support the above cloud datasets. Check the [fsspec documentation](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to learn more.\n",

    "If you are in the cloud the secrets for dataset access may already exist in your environment. In this case, you may not need to do anything. \n",
